# Task_HPCTools

To execute the code we enter the parameter like we run a *.c file => command line : ./* 3 (if you initialize the program with a 3x3 matrix).
But my code is not really efficient. Indeed when the compiler is not gcc/8.1.0 version the final matrix result a segmentation fault.
If you run a non matrix 5x5 or higher, the program crash. Sorry for that work.

To read my result of those compilation you have to enter in the branch : task2 (Branch of the master)
